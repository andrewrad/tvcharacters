# TV Characters

This project is a sample app that fetches and displays data from a RESTful Web api. This app displays the characters from The Simpsons and The Wire as two seperate apps with shared codebase.  
The app uses Kotlin, databinding, MVVM, and Hilt which are the latest standards in the Android community. As a bonus, there are a few noted features:

* An options selector to sort the list by ascending, descending, and whether the character has an icon. 
* The database uses FTS, a much-preferred search library for databases. 
* Added motion for when the character name, image, and text is displayed


### Instructions 

Open the build.gradle file in the main directory (like any project)
To run both apps, open build variant in lower left corner and select either "simpsons" or "wire" 
This project was built with Android Studio 4.1.2
